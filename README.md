# BulkFileRename
This is a very simple program that i wrote to help me rename a large number of files automatically in order to organize my photo library.

I have added some abstraction in the naming, to make it easier to change in the future, if i want a different namming pattern. I will add these as needed.
Perhaps someday, i will add GUI to make it easier to use,
